## Project Summary

Our project is a website that helps users plan a trip based on a movie. A user can search a movie they like, and the website will show real-world places that appear in the movie. Then the user can save these places into a trip plan.

We will use two datasets: one for movies and one for books. If a movie is adapted from a book, the website can also recommend the book to the user. We will use an AI API to help find the real places for a movie and show them in the app.
